            请女性朋友们原谅此作者，本书出版于1930年，作者的性别主义是时代局限性的体现。  
            男性朋友们也请有意识地将“man”自动替换为无性别指向的“人”。

            至今也有人认为男性更复杂，自然也有人认为宗教虔诚仍然是普世价值。我本人把这条看作与"man,
            he"一样的时代局限性，毕竟，本书成书于1930年的美国，那可是禁酒令的时代。

            你觉得作者语境下的Religous life大概是什么样子，是否等于宗教虔诚？non-religious life又是什么样子？


            ### [](#chapter-xxvii-he-lives-a-great-religious-life)CHAPTER XXVII
            He Lives a Great Religious Life


            If science has done nothing more than to bring men speed, comfort,
            luxury, money and playthings, it is not worth the price we have paid
            for it.


            Unless it has brought men a better religion, sounder morals and a
            richer humanism, then the old days of dogmatism, ignorance,
            superstition, hate, war, persecution and bloodshed, which have been
            the fruits of all the religions of the past, were better, I think,
            than the prospect which lies ahead.


            This is precisely the situation which faces both science and social
            order throughout the world to-day. For science has given men its
            products and instru- ments, but it has not given them its religion,
            its ethics, and its humanism. It has given men its material life,
            but not its spiritual life ; it has not taught the masses of men a
            new way to live.


            Here, then, lies the practical danger. Science has mechanized all
            civilization. It has invented a world machine. And after it invented
            this world machine the business men and politicians ran away with it
            and thought they could manage it without the scientific spirit. A
            man in an airplane is not of necessity any more emancipated, sane,
            wise, tolerant or civilized than a man in an ox-cart. Science can
            not emancipate men unless they catch its spirit. When men take
            posses- sion of its machines, chemicals, communication and
            transportation without its liberalizing spirit they ex- ploit men
            and exploit life — they do not teach, nor en- lighten, nor free the
            human spirit. They chain men to bigger and bigger machines beyond
            their power to understand or to control. They make new devices for
            war ; they use propaganda to control opinion ; they use the power of
            law and government and the courts and press to throttle free thought
            and free teaching. They build schools for their children with the
            aid of science and then gag the teachers within their walls. Dogma-
            tism with the added power of scientific instruments and inventions
            is thus the most dangerous thing to common men that has ever entered
            the world. For, if dogmatism becomes armed with the instru- ments of
            science, especially with its ease of communica- tion and power of
            propaganda, then the days when woman’s beauty and man’s heroism were
            thrown into the lion’s mouth for so-called conscience’s sake will
            seem like good old days, indeed. Hell hath no fury like dogmatism
            and bigotry with science as their hand- maiden.


            如果你认为原文中的man并不是指人类，而是指的男人，你可能会认为man可以用human/person来替代，虽然我的英文老师曾教过man也可以指包括男女在内的human的。


            那么，你认为作者在原文谈到的religious life的内涵，在你认为的现代语境里应当用什么名词或对象来替代？

            你觉得religion, faith, belief, God, theology, spiritual,
            这些词汇之间是否都是指同一个东西？还是在描述某一个领域的不同事物？

            1930年的纽约已经是满城汽车，曼哈顿已经是摩天大厦林立、天际线跟今天差不多了，电报已经非常普及、越洋电话已经打通，很多人都使用上了电话，纽交所和一些大新闻机构之间已经使用的蒸汽驱动自动邮件投递网络，相当于今天的电子邮件。客机、越洋渡轮都非常普及，铁路网络早就四通八达。爱因斯坦的相对论已经提出。你觉得那个时代受过教育的美国人或者纽约人比今天的地球人要缺乏对科学技术对生活的影响的理解差很多吗？

            没必要为作者文过饰非，那个年代，谈论起教育和修养，指的就是男人和极少数“脱离了女性桎梏而得到男人资格”的女人。


            > Unless it (science) has brought men a better religion, sounder
            morals and a richer humanism, then the old days of dogmatism,
            ignorance, superstition, hate, war, persecution and bloodshed, which
            have been the fruits of all the religions of the past, were better,
            I think, than the prospect which lies ahead.


            这段表述，和“宁要社会主义的草，不要资本主义的苗”异曲同工。我能够理解作者的思路，他认为宗教是道德和人道主义的基石，没有宗教，则“礼崩乐坏”，世界陷入仇恨和战争。这种思路是根据欧洲历史总结出来的规律。在宗教唯一的情况下，存在唯一的“至高规则”，这种说法可以逻辑自洽。当世界变小，人们越来越多地直接面对不同教条的冲突时，宗教道德论就显得有些无力了。


            随着社会学、哲学的发展，道德会越来越少地由“认知”定义，越来越多地由“理性”定义。如果人道主义不再需要宗教背书，宗教就不再是绝对必要的。目前来看，各国政治家们的言论里就可以找到这个发展中的替代品：“普世价值”。  
              
            #8
            讨论哲学和神学，我会像包子一样露馅的……对我个人而言，faith是认知论上的概念。人存在，就必然要对世界有基本认知，faith就是那些“无法证明，我们也不去证明的基本前提”；数学中的“公理”，大概可以用来做个类比。Belief则是在faith基础上，通过逻辑推导，得出的有条件的“定理”。


            其余几个词就进入神学范围了吧。这些词汇排个顺序，大约是这样的：faith -> belief -> theology ->
            spiritual -> religion -> God


            有神论和无神论，在faith和belief层级就分道扬镳。在宗教话题上吵架而无法沟通的，大多是误会了双方共识处于哪个层级。

            对科学技术的理解，不是由技术水平决定，而是由社会学发展水平决定，1930年大概还在开荒时代……


            我想起来那个笑话，科学哲学之于科学，相当于鸟类分类学之于鸟类。
