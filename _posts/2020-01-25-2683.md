            只有英法美韩在武汉有领事馆。

            其他三国应该都会跟进吧。

            能撤出就好，不然，“走着走着就倒地，屠城，屠城…”会吓都吓出i病来了。

            总体失控的话，那就会在彻底失控前1，2周进行全国范围的撤侨了。我所指的是武汉，尤其是湖北境内的小城镇。他们所处区域信息更闭塞，资源更匮乏，会翻墙传播信息的人更少，境外义士能关注到他们的可能性更小。

            而在他们那种地方，可能会发生更多的悲剧，然而这些真相更难传出来。没人能救他们，甚至没人知道他们死了。这是最悲哀的。

            ========================================================================================================================================================================================================


            [https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/coronavirus-china-live-updates/2020/01/25/0ca57a5e-3ed7-11ea-afe2-090eb37b60b1\_story.html](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/coronavirus-china-live-updates/2020/01/25/0ca57a5e-3ed7-11ea-afe2-090eb37b60b1_story.html)


            WASHINGTON — The U.S. Embassy in Beijing is exploring options to
            help U.S. citizens in Wuhan, but reports that a charter flight was
            being arranged to bring citizens and diplomats back to the United
            States are false, according to a voice mail at the embassy.


            When a Washington Post reporter called the U.S. embassy in Beijing
            to inquire about the chartered flight, the reporter was directed to
            a voicemail that said the reports were false and there were "no
            confirmed arrangements at this time." Americans in Wuhan who are
            looking for assistance or are trying to leave the city were directed
            to an email address.

            那是好事。不撤，留下，说明还没“屠城”，也不会“走着走着就倒毙了”。中共就无法彻底封锁消息。

            ===============================================================================================================================================================================================================


            SHANGHAI—The U.S. State Department said Sunday that it is organizing
            a single flight out of the central Chinese city of Wuhan, confirming
            efforts to extricate diplomats and a limited number of private U.S.
            citizens from the virus-hit city.

            leave Paris on Wednesday and return the next day. The flight will
            carry people with no symptoms, junior transport minister
            Jean-Baptiste Djebarri told television channel CNews. “These people
            will be put under quarantine. And then there will be a second
            flight, at a yet undefined date, with people showing symptoms ...
            who will be cared for in Paris,” he said.
                
            *   South Korea plans to send charter flights this week to evacuate
            its citizens from Wuhan, Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun said on
            Tuesday. The planes will arrive in the city as early as Thursday, he
            told a ministerial meeting aimed at discussing efforts to prevent
            the spread of the new coronavirus.

            Japan. Motegi said Tokyo is making arrangements for extra flights to
            Wuhan as early as Wednesday. Those with symptoms such as fever will
            be sent to hospital on landing at Tokyo’s Haneda airport, while
            those with no signs of virus can go home and then to work or school,
            but will be advised to avoid crowds and take their temperatures
            twice a day.
                
            *   Kazakhstan has asked Beijing to allow 98 Kazakh students to

            *   The U.S. State Department said it will evacuate personnel from
            its Wuhan consulate to the United States and offer a limited number
            of seats to private U.S. citizens on a flight. Some private citizens
            will be able to board the “single flight” leaving Wuhan on Jan. 28
            for San Francisco, it said.
                
            *   Britain is talking to international partners to find solutions

            *   Canada has about 167 nationals in the Wuhan area, Foreign
            Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said on Monday, and eight
            people have sought consular assistance, which is being provided.
            While the minister did not rule out possible evacuations, he did not
            indicate there were any planned at the moment, adding that each
            consular request would be evaluated on a “case by case basis”.
                
            *   Russia has been in talks with China about evacuating its

            呆在武汉也无事可干，天天发呆，“君子不立危墙之下”，不如撤回，安全。体现负责。也说明武汉整体上是有序的，不是啥“屠城啊’，无政府状态。


            还有把握不会因此导致“扩散”。

华尔街日报星期六报道说，美国计划从武汉撤侨，星期天将安排包机前往武汉，将美国公民和外交官从这个被疫情笼罩的城市撤回美国。

一位知情人士对华尔街日报说，这架能乘坐230人的包机将接回美国驻武汉领事馆的美国公民和他们的家人，撤出的人士需承担相关费用。

报道称，最近几天，在经过磋商后，华盛顿获得中国外交部和其他政府机构的同意。美国也计划暂时关闭武汉领事馆。

美国国务院星期五（1月24日）将针对湖北的旅行警告升至最高级别的“四级”，警告美国公民不要前往湖北，并表示国务院前一天已经下令非紧急雇员和他们的家人离开，美国政府向湖北省的美国公民提供紧急服务的能力有限。
