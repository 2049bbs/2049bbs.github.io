            ========================================================================================================================================================================================================


            [https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/coronavirus-china-live-updates/2020/01/25/0ca57a5e-3ed7-11ea-afe2-090eb37b60b1\_story.html](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/coronavirus-china-live-updates/2020/01/25/0ca57a5e-3ed7-11ea-afe2-090eb37b60b1_story.html)


            WASHINGTON — The U.S. Embassy in Beijing is exploring options to
            help U.S. citizens in Wuhan, but reports that a charter flight was
            being arranged to bring citizens and diplomats back to the United
            States are false, according to a voice mail at the embassy.


            When a Washington Post reporter called the U.S. embassy in Beijing
            to inquire about the chartered flight, the reporter was directed to
            a voicemail that said the reports were false and there were "no
            confirmed arrangements at this time." Americans in Wuhan who are
            looking for assistance or are trying to leave the city were directed
            to an email address.

            While the minister did not rule out possible evacuations, he did not

华尔街日报星期六报道说，美国计划从武汉撤侨，星期天将安排包机前往武汉，将美国公民和外交官从这个被疫情笼罩的城市撤回美国。

一位知情人士对华尔街日报说，这架能乘坐230人的包机将接回美国驻武汉领事馆的美国公民和他们的家人，撤出的人士需承担相关费用。

报道称，最近几天，在经过磋商后，华盛顿获得中国外交部和其他政府机构的同意。美国也计划暂时关闭武汉领事馆。

美国国务院星期五（1月24日）将针对湖北的旅行警告升至最高级别的“四级”，警告美国公民不要前往湖北，并表示国务院前一天已经下令非紧急雇员和他们的家人离开，美国政府向湖北省的美国公民提供紧急服务的能力有限。
