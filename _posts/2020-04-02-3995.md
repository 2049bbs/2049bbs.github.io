            > NEW YORK -- Put on Dua Lipa's sophomore album and you'll
            experience of party -- a collection of upbeat, dance-flavoured,
            power-pop gems that could brighten your day. But take a closer,
            deeper look, and you'll also find songs brimmed with messages of
            hope, equality and vulnerability.

            > 

            > Lipa closes her 11-track "Future Nostalgia" release with "Boys
            Will Be Boys," a song about the growing pains of life as a woman
            with clever, sharp lyrics like:

            > 

            > **"I'm sure if there's something that I can't find the words to
            say,**

            > 

            > **I know that there will be a man around to save the day,**

            > 

            > **And that was sarcasm, in case you needed it mansplained,**

            > 

            > **I should've stuck to ballet."**


            夹带私货一次XD
