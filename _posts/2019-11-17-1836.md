            举手之劳，不过精力还是要放在香港本土，时刻关注前线勇武，希望人人得以平安。

            > Time magazine also holds an online poll for the readers to vote
            for who they believe to be the Person of the Year. While many
            mistakenly believe the winner of the poll to be the Person of the
            Year, the title, as mentioned above, is decided by the editors of
            Time. In the first online poll held in 1998, wrestler and activist
            Mick Foley won with over 50% of the votes.\[15\]\[16\] Foley was
            removed from the poll, and the title was given to Bill Clinton and
            Ken Starr, which led to outrage from the fans of Foley who
            mistakenly believed the winner of the poll would be the winner of
            the title. In 2006, the poll winner by a wide margin was Hugo
            Chávez, with 35% of the votes. The president of Iran, Mahmoud
            Ahmadinejad, came in second. Time again ignored those results, not
            mentioning them in the announcement of the Person of the Year.\[17\]
            Time continues to annually run an online poll for the "People's
            Choice", but stresses the decision on whom the magazine recognizes
            is not made by the poll, but by the magazine's editors.\[18\]
