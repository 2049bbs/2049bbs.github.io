one belt one road，我认为最好翻译为世界只有一条纽带，只有和中共合作这一条路，否则别想进入中国市场。 看看西方公正报道：Spain unlikely to join China’s Belt and Road initiative. Spain is unlikely to join China’s Belt and Road initiative during Chinese President Xi Jinping’s ongoing state visit, despite Beijing’s eagerness to expand cooperation under its ambitious infrastructure and trade project.

A senior official from the Spanish prime minister’s office told AFP on Tuesday that the Southern European country would not sign a memorandum of understanding regarding the Belt and Road initiative.

"Europe has a connectivity initiative with Asia, so we think Europeans should work within this framework," said the official, who refused to be named.

The European Union unveiled a high-level strategy for improving the 28-nation bloc’s transport, energy, and digital infrastructure links with Asia in September, along with a planned increase of its external action budget.

The EU’s move was widely seen as a counter to China’s Belt and Road initiative, which was announced by Xi five years ago for boosting trade through massive investment in ports, power plants and other infrastructure across Asia, Europe and Africa.

The Spanish government official’s statement came on the same day that Xi began his three-day visit to the country ahead of the G20 summit in Argentina later this week.

China has already launched a direct cargo train link between the cities of Yiwu and Madrid while state-owned COSCO shipping company’s majority stake in the firm operating ports in Valencia and Bilbao.

However, Spain’s refusal to officially join the initiative may disappoint Beijing, which has already succeeded in enlisting over 100 countries and international organisations to the project.
