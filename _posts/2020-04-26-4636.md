            根据BE4的帖子改写。改动比较多。


            可以考虑发的对象：议员，政治人物，大众媒体人物，尤其是关注COVID和中国话题的。


            以下是模板，报名时可以使用真名，也可以假名（如一个随机英文名），重点在于传递信息、引起关注：


            Dear Mr./Ms. \[Name\],


            My name is XXX. I am writing to urge you to voice for two young
            Chinese COVID-19 activists, who were detained by Beijing police on
            April 19, 2020, and had been held incommunicado ever since, after
            sharing censored coronavirus materials on crowdsourcing site Github.


            Their stories have been covered by multiple media outlets such as
            New York Times
            (https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/04/world/asia/china-coronavirus-answers.html),
            Daily Mail
            (https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8261025/Three-Beijing-activists-missing-preserving-virus-articles-online.html),
            and Sky News Australia
            (https://www.skynews.com.au/details/\_6160626747001). Organizations
            such as Amnesty International
            (https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa17/2289/2020/en/) and
            Reporters without Borders
            (https://rsf.org/en/news/china-detained-fighting-censorship) have
            also called for their release. Recently, UN High Commissioner for
            Human Rights Michelle Bachelet also expressed her concerns about the
            detaining of Cai and Chen
            (https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=25920&LangID=E).


            Cai and Chen were contributors to a crowd-sourced Github project
            known as Terminus2049, which aims at overcoming China's censorship
            by preserving censored news content. Since the COVID-19 outbreak in
            China, they have collected and archived around 100 articles related
            to the pandemic, with topics ranging from leaked documents to
            deleted news. On April 19, 2020, Cai and Chen were arrested on
            charges of “picking quarrels and stirring up trouble”, an accusation
            often used against political activists in China. Since then, they
            had been kept under “residential surveillance in a designated
            location (RSDL)”, a term that refers to China’s “secret prisons.”
            Detainees under RSDL are deprived of their legal rights such as
            access to attorneys, and face high risks of tortures and
            ill-treatment.


            Cai graduated from one of China's top universities, Tsinghua
            University, with a master's degree in sociology; and Chen graduated
            from South China Agricultural University. They have both volunteered
            in multiple non-profit organizations focused on education and public
            welfare. Since 2018, Cai and Chen had been fighting in the frontline
            for the freedom of speech and press in China. Their crowd-sourced
            social projects help to wake and encourage tens of thousands of
            Chinese both in mainland and oversea to join the campaigns against
            the censorship and propaganda orchestrated by the Chinese Communist
            Party.


            Since the pandemic, there have been more than 3700 COVID-19 related
            arrests made in China. With the increasing toll from COVID-19 we
            have seen first hand the costs of censorship from the CCP in the
            lives of innocent people all over the world. U.S. Assistant
            Secretary Robert Destro voiced for Chen and Cai on twitter
            (https://twitter.com/DRL\_AS/status/1255239304986624002) and called
            it "shameful" to arrest and detain people who try to share
            information about COVID-19. "What is the CCP so afraid they might
            uncover?" He asked, "We need transparency to fight this pandemic
            together." This isn’t a matter of politics, this is a matter of
            basic human rights.


            Therefore, I urge you, please voice for the Cai and Chen, calling
            Beijing to reveal their detained location and latest conditions, let
            them see their family and attorneys, and help them to avoid further
            restriction of freedom and torture.


            Thank you very much!


            Sincerely,


            \[Your Name\]

Please voice for three Chinese Covid-19 activists detained by Beijing police

[](#content-template)content template:
--------------------------------------

Dear Sir/Madam \[Name of Congressman\],

My name is XXX, a resident of \[hometown\] from the district of Senator \[name\]. I am writing to urge you voice for 3 young Chinese activists in Beijing, who were detained on April 19, 2020, after sharing censored coronavirus material on crowdsourcing site Github. (Source https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3081569/chinese-activists-detained-after-sharing-censored-coronavirus) At this moment, they were kept in an unknown place by Beijing police, leaving their desperate parents alone. Please voice for the trio, calling Beijing to release their detained location and health condition, help them to avoid further restriction of freedom, torture or even disappearance.

"The trio – Cai Wei, his girlfriend, a woman surnamed Tang, and Chen Mei – were contributors to a crowd-sourced project known as Terminus2049 that began in 2018 and collected articles that had been removed from mainstream media outlets and social media. Microsoft-owned Github lets programmers collaborate on code, but has increasingly become a haven for Chinese activists who want to circumvent the Great Firewall to publish censored content."

According to evidences provided by one of their anonymous collaborators (Chinese Source: https://github.com/2049bbs/2049bbs.github.io/blob/master/README.md), Cai Wei is the owner of Github account 'TerminusBot' (https://github.com/Terminus2049), which has been inactive since April 18th. Via TerminusBot, Cai Wei running tens of crowd-sourced social projects, including the crowd-sourced project Terminus2049 (https://github.com/Terminus2049/Terminus2049.github.io) and a Chinese BBS website (url https://2049bbs.xyz, codebase https://github.com/Terminus2049/2049bbs ). The Github account TerminusBot (renamed from Tsai1993) is linked to Cai Wei's Tsinghua university email ([\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)). Note: In Chinese language, Tsai = Cai, the former is used in Taiwan, the latter is used in mainland China.

Since 2018, the trio and their crowd-sourced social projects made huge impact via fighting the censorship in China. Cai Wei and their online followers are fighting in the frontline for the freedom of speech in China during Hongkong protests and Wuhan coronavius pandemic in 2019-2020. Their crowd-sourced social projects help to wake and encourage tens of thousands of Chinese both in mainland and oversea to join the counter-campaigns against the disinformation campaigns funded and orchestrated by the Chinese Communist Party.

I urge you to voice for these activists, Cai Wei, Miss Tang, and Chen Mei, calling the Chinese police to publish their detaining location and latest conditions, and calling for their immediate release. The three young people are the latest example of human rights abuses and information warfare committed by Chinese Communist Party to its own citizens as well as to the whole world, after the Chinese whistleblower Li Wenliang, and disappeared citizen journalists Fang Bin and Li Zehua.

Here is the detailed information of the three young heroes (Source https://www.epochtimes.com/gb/20/4/25/n12060478.htm ) if any help:

Cai Wei was born in Hubei and was born in 1993. He used to work for an Internet company in Beijing. He got bachelor's degree from Central University of Finance and Economics and master's degree from the Department of Social Sciences of Tsinghua University in 2018. Volunteer in youth education activities during college.

Chen Mei was born in Shaanxi and was born in 1993. He graduated from South China Agricultural University in 2016. Worked in a public welfare organization in Beijing, and raised books and organized public welfare lectures for public welfare activities.

Miss Tang is a native of Anhui. She was born in 1990, graduated from Peking University's Department of Sociology with a master's degree.

Coming from a nation founded on the principles of freedom you must understand how critical this moment is. We have seen first hand the costs of censorship from the CCP in the lives of innocent Americans. This oppressive government has now ripped away the very basic freedom of life and liberty from countless people that it can't go unnoticed. Actions taken during hard times like these define who we are, and sitting back and letting this regime have its way makes us no better than them. If you share these values of freedom that our ancestors risked their lives for I urge you to take action and speak out in support of those fighting for freedom on the front line in mainland China. This isn’t a matter of communism versus democracies, this is a matter of basic human rights.

Thank you very much!

Sincerely,
