            蠻貼合當下的議題，感謝分享。原版 “**What Is Populism?**”
            在amazon上評分4星半，相當不錯了，從rating數量可以判斷這也是本暢銷書。發現有條review很有趣，對本書批判意味濃，信息量較大，也頗有特別的見地，複製上來供參考。

              

            **David Lindsay**： **Jan-Werner Müller** is German and teaches
            politics at Princeton. Muller discusses populism and many of the
            leaders who have been described as populist in recent years. The
            list includes Trump, Erdogan, Wilders, Orban, Le Pen, Farage, and
            Chavez. Populism is defined in the Oxford dictionary as: "A
            political approach that strives to appeal to ordinary people who
            feel that their concerns are disregarded by established elite
            groups." Muller uses the term pejoratively. Ultimately, his book
            asks the question, whether the political elite should carry out the
            will of the people; or impose its own "superior" views on society.
            Muller seems to favor the latter and for some reason views this as
            the democratic option. Muller is a master of Orwellian doublethink.
            I have lived in the U.S. and Europe. I disagreed with most of his
            argument and his version of European history. Instead, I would
            recommend **National Populism: The Revolt Against Liberal
            Democracy** by two British academics, Roger Eatwell and Matthew
            Goodwin.

              

            Populists are already in government in some way in six EU member
            states: The list includes Austria, the Czech Republic, Greece,
            Hungary, Italy, and Poland. Across the EU there are 11 populist
            parties with popular support above 20%, implying that the number of
            populist governments could roughly double.

              

            Muller believes that we should fear populism, but he conflates the
            term with totalitarianism, which is a mistake. He believes that the
            end game for populists is a country that looks like Nazi Germany or
            the Soviet Union. Both countries elected leaders who became
            dictators. Lenin in 1917 and Hitler in 1933. Muller describes the
            playbook used by both men. They used lies and violence to take power
            and then crushed their opponents after they won control.

              

            Muller ignores the reasons why populism has recently reemerged in
            the West. Free market policies have increased inequality and the
            working class is being left behind. Most people want immigration
            controls and they expected their governments to deliver. Instead,
            people have been told to get used to immigration and to focus on its
            benefits. The liberal elite seems to fear being accused of racism
            and they can see the benefits of cheap imported labor. My mother is
            retired and lives in Britain. She has employed Polish gardeners,
            plumbers, and decorators to remodel her house. She tells me they do
            a great job and are cheap. She wasn't too bothered about the local
            people she deprived of the work.

              

            Muller is worried about Trump and Brexit and sees totalitarians
            everywhere. There are fears in the mainstream media about Poland,
            Hungary and the Czech Republic going over to the dark side. I worked
            in Eastern Europe after the Soviet Union collapsed. These countries
            were occupied by the Nazis and then the Soviets and have fought to
            preserve their culture. The EU does not believe in national
            identity. Muller has unusual views about how democracy works. He
            seems to believe that the people should accept the policies handed
            down by technocratic elites because these people are experts and
            they are better qualified to make decisions. If the people reject
            their policies he regards them as populists and therefore
            anti-democratic. The European media has often labeled opponents of
            immigration as "far-right" or "neo-Nazi."

              

            To summarize, Muller argues that populism threatens the very basis
            of democracy. It does so by undermining the idea of pluralism. He
            believes that populists claim to represent the people but they
            create their own elites once they obtain power, like the Nazis and
            Communists. He believes that populist parties are authoritarian and
            often have a supreme leader (e.g., Hitler, Lenin or Mao). Once
            ensconced in power, populist leaders find scapegoats to blame for
            problems that emerge: corrupt elites, saboteurs, the media, foreign
            meddlers and so on. They prepare the people for some kind of
            showdown with the alleged enemies of the people. Once in power,
            populist leaders destroy democratic norms to consolidate power and
            crush their critics, just as Hitler and Lenin did.

              

            None of this seems applicable to the U.S. and UK. This is something
            Muller fails to grasp. Both countries rejected extremism during the
            Great Depression. The U.S. elected FDR while the Germans elected
            Adolf Hitler. Britain picked two moderates before ending up with
            Neville Chamberlain, a Conservative, who declared war on Hitler.
            Brexit is unlikely to lead to another Third Reich. Ironically, some
            Brexit supporters feared that the EU was turning into a Fourth Reich
            ruled by Germany. Müller has an obsession with Britain’s Nigel
            Farage and implies that he is a dictator in waiting, this is
            nonsense. Farage is a vocal and effective critic of the EU and a
            former commodities trader. Farage has made eight failed attempts to
            become a British member of parliament. Mature democracies should be
            able to handle robust debate and cope with people like Farage who
            use their right of free speech to question the political
            establishment.

              

            Britain's political parties often started out as populist movements.
            The British Labour Party was created in 1893 because many in the
            working class did not believe their grievances were being properly
            addressed. It initially grew out of the trade union movement and the
            church. Its first leader was a lay preacher. New parties often
            emerge as society evolves. The Labour Party, despite its populist
            roots, has not produced any demagogic leaders and has not tried to
            overthrow democracy.

              

            Muller is a true believer in the EU. The EU has a population of 510
            million people and there are 28 member countries. Its long-term aim
            is to create a United States of Europe. It lacks America's
            homogenous culture and a common language. It increasingly suffers
            from a democratic deficit between Brussels and outlying regions. Its
            evangelists aim to create an ideal society ruled by technocrats. In
            Europe, the technocrats are increasingly seen as distant,
            unaccountable, and arrogant. The EU is also plagued with groupthink
            and ignores views it does not like. European history tells us that
            when elites ignore the people bad things can happen.

              

            The EU's current economic problems were triggered by the 2008
            financial crises and the euro. How it reacted made things worse and
            helps explain the rise in populism. Austerity economics in the
            eurozone has resulted in slow growth and high unemployment since
            2008. The EU replaced “populist” leaders in Greece and Italy. Greece
            then lost 30% of its GDP and its unemployment is still above 20%. A
            large section of the Italian public is increasingly hostile to the
            euro. The country has had virtually no economic growth since 1999.
            Many Italians believe they need a change of direction, and an
            anti-EU government has just taken power in Italy. According to Tim
            Geithner, a former U.S. Treasury Secretary, the EU asked the U.S. to
            approve the removal of Silvio Berlusconi, a previous Italian
            president who would not do as he was told.

              

            Europe's populist leaders have become a thorn in the side of the EU.
            Hungary's leader, Viktor Orban, is accused of being anti-democratic,
            however, he was recently elected with a two-thirds majority in a
            national election. Many of his nationalistic policies are not
            acceptable to the EU, however, they are popular with a majority of
            Hungarians, especially those who want to limit immigration. The
            implication is that Orban is misleading the Hungarian people and
            they are too stupid or racist to notice. The question is whether
            Hungarians need the approval of the EU to run their country the way
            they want to.

              

            Muller argues that in Europe and the United States it is less
            educated white males that are attracted to populism. For some
            reason, their views don't seem to count. The reviews on the dust
            jacket agree that Muller has brilliant insights, but he does not
            seem to understand that populism grows when elites are out of touch.
            The EU's problem is that it is not willing to listen to its people's
            concerns. The EU wants a federal Europe but many of its citizens
            don't. Muller fears the return of totalitarianism, but what seems
            more likely is the break-up of the EU.

▌所有權力皆來自人民，但何處是它的去向？ ——德國劇作家｜貝托爾特•布萊希特（Bertolt Brecht）▌

——當民粹主義浪潮成為席捲世界的海嘯—— 民粹到底是民主最正統的聲音？還是民主面臨的最大危機？

◤充滿政治激情與煽動口號的民粹時代降臨◢

美國總統川普、英國脫歐領袖法拉奇、法國反移民大將勒龐、

前委瑞內拉總統查維茲、土耳其總統艾爾多安——民粹領袖在世界各地崛起。

但我們真的了解民粹主義嗎？為何它是如此迷人又危險的存在？

每一個批評體制內菁英的人，就應該被稱為民粹主義者嗎？民粹政治行動者都是右派嗎？民粹主義讓政府更接近民眾？「真正的人民」到底是誰，誰又可以為人民發聲？在自由民主制度正面對風起雲湧挑戰的當下，探究這些問題從未像現在這麼具有急迫性。

由普林斯頓大學政治學教授——揚—威爾納‧穆勒（Jan-Werner Müller）所撰寫的《解讀民粹主義》（WHAT IS POPULISM?）以歷史為基礎，援引拉丁美洲、歐洲與美國的例子，定義了民粹主義的特徵，以及探索民粹主義在我們這個時代之所以能勝出的更深層原因：民粹主義者的樣貌究竟為何？使用怎樣的政治語言？掌權後會有哪些典型作為？又該如何對抗民粹主義者並與其對話？作者穆勒主張，民粹主義的核心就是反對多元主義。民粹主義者總是會宣稱，他們（而且只有他們）代表人民以及人民的真正利益。他也說明，和傳統觀點相反，民粹主義者可以根據他們是人民獨家的道德代表而執政；如果民粹主義者擁有足夠的權力，最後將建立一個威權國家，並排除所有不被認為是適當「人民」一分子的人。

現今的民粹主義者正嘗試運用符合民主價值的政治語言，實現一個公然反對民主的政治理想。透過《解讀民粹主義》書中極具啟發性的論點，我們不僅可以認識民粹對民主制度的威脅為何，並促使大家反思該如何修正失能的民主代議制度。自由民主人士究竟該如何應對民粹主義者，特別是在當他們宣稱專為「沉默的多數」或「真正的人民」而發聲的時候。本書不僅為讀者釐清民粹主義的樣貌和特徵，也幫助讀者進一步理解這個民粹主義當道的時代。
