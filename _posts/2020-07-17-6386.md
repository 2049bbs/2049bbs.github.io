            蠻貼合當下的議題，感謝分享。原版 “**What Is Populism?**”
            在amazon上評分4星半，相當不錯了，從rating數量可以判斷這也是本暢銷書。發現有條review很有趣，對本書批判意味濃，信息量較大，也頗有特別的見地，複製上來供參考。

              

            **David Lindsay**： **Jan-Werner Müller** is German and teaches
            politics at Princeton. Muller discusses populism and many of the
            leaders who have been described as populist in recent years. The
            list includes Trump, Erdogan, Wilders, Orban, Le Pen, Farage, and
            Chavez. Populism is defined in the Oxford dictionary as: "A
            political approach that strives to appeal to ordinary people who
            feel that their concerns are disregarded by established elite
            groups." Muller uses the term pejoratively. Ultimately, his book
            asks the question, whether the political elite should carry out the
            will of the people; or impose its own "superior" views on society.
            Muller seems to favor the latter and for some reason views this as
            the democratic option. Muller is a master of Orwellian doublethink.
            I have lived in the U.S. and Europe. I disagreed with most of his
            argument and his version of European history. Instead, I would
            recommend **National Populism: The Revolt Against Liberal
            Democracy** by two British academics, Roger Eatwell and Matthew
            Goodwin.

              

            Populists are already in government in some way in six EU member
            states: The list includes Austria, the Czech Republic, Greece,
            Hungary, Italy, and Poland. Across the EU there are 11 populist
            parties with popular support above 20%, implying that the number of
            populist governments could roughly double.

              

            Muller believes that we should fear populism, but he conflates the
            term with totalitarianism, which is a mistake. He believes that the
            end game for populists is a country that looks like Nazi Germany or
            the Soviet Union. Both countries elected leaders who became
            dictators. Lenin in 1917 and Hitler in 1933. Muller describes the
            playbook used by both men. They used lies and violence to take power
            and then crushed their opponents after they won control.

              

            Muller ignores the reasons why populism has recently reemerged in
            the West. Free market policies have increased inequality and the
            working class is being left behind. Most people want immigration
            controls and they expected their governments to deliver. Instead,
            people have been told to get used to immigration and to focus on its
            benefits. The liberal elite seems to fear being accused of racism
            and they can see the benefits of cheap imported labor. My mother is
            retired and lives in Britain. She has employed Polish gardeners,
            plumbers, and decorators to remodel her house. She tells me they do
            a great job and are cheap. She wasn't too bothered about the local
            people she deprived of the work.

              

            Muller is worried about Trump and Brexit and sees totalitarians
            everywhere. There are fears in the mainstream media about Poland,
            Hungary and the Czech Republic going over to the dark side. I worked
            in Eastern Europe after the Soviet Union collapsed. These countries
            were occupied by the Nazis and then the Soviets and have fought to
            preserve their culture. The EU does not believe in national
            identity. Muller has unusual views about how democracy works. He
            seems to believe that the people should accept the policies handed
            down by technocratic elites because these people are experts and
            they are better qualified to make decisions. If the people reject
            their policies he regards them as populists and therefore
            anti-democratic. The European media has often labeled opponents of
            immigration as "far-right" or "neo-Nazi."

              

            To summarize, Muller argues that populism threatens the very basis
            of democracy. It does so by undermining the idea of pluralism. He
            believes that populists claim to represent the people but they
            create their own elites once they obtain power, like the Nazis and
            Communists. He believes that populist parties are authoritarian and
            often have a supreme leader (e.g., Hitler, Lenin or Mao). Once
            ensconced in power, populist leaders find scapegoats to blame for
            problems that emerge: corrupt elites, saboteurs, the media, foreign
            meddlers and so on. They prepare the people for some kind of
            showdown with the alleged enemies of the people. Once in power,
            populist leaders destroy democratic norms to consolidate power and
            crush their critics, just as Hitler and Lenin did.

              

            None of this seems applicable to the U.S. and UK. This is something
            Muller fails to grasp. Both countries rejected extremism during the
            Great Depression. The U.S. elected FDR while the Germans elected
            Adolf Hitler. Britain picked two moderates before ending up with
            Neville Chamberlain, a Conservative, who declared war on Hitler.
            Brexit is unlikely to lead to another Third Reich. Ironically, some
            Brexit supporters feared that the EU was turning into a Fourth Reich
            ruled by Germany. Müller has an obsession with Britain’s Nigel
            Farage and implies that he is a dictator in waiting, this is
            nonsense. Farage is a vocal and effective critic of the EU and a
            former commodities trader. Farage has made eight failed attempts to
            become a British member of parliament. Mature democracies should be
            able to handle robust debate and cope with people like Farage who
            use their right of free speech to question the political
            establishment.

              

            Britain's political parties often started out as populist movements.
            The British Labour Party was created in 1893 because many in the
            working class did not believe their grievances were being properly
            addressed. It initially grew out of the trade union movement and the
            church. Its first leader was a lay preacher. New parties often
            emerge as society evolves. The Labour Party, despite its populist
            roots, has not produced any demagogic leaders and has not tried to
            overthrow democracy.

              

            Muller is a true believer in the EU. The EU has a population of 510
            million people and there are 28 member countries. Its long-term aim
            is to create a United States of Europe. It lacks America's
            homogenous culture and a common language. It increasingly suffers
            from a democratic deficit between Brussels and outlying regions. Its
            evangelists aim to create an ideal society ruled by technocrats. In
            Europe, the technocrats are increasingly seen as distant,
            unaccountable, and arrogant. The EU is also plagued with groupthink
            and ignores views it does not like. European history tells us that
            when elites ignore the people bad things can happen.

              

            The EU's current economic problems were triggered by the 2008
            financial crises and the euro. How it reacted made things worse and
            helps explain the rise in populism. Austerity economics in the
            eurozone has resulted in slow growth and high unemployment since
            2008. The EU replaced “populist” leaders in Greece and Italy. Greece
            then lost 30% of its GDP and its unemployment is still above 20%. A
            large section of the Italian public is increasingly hostile to the
            euro. The country has had virtually no economic growth since 1999.
            Many Italians believe they need a change of direction, and an
            anti-EU government has just taken power in Italy. According to Tim
            Geithner, a former U.S. Treasury Secretary, the EU asked the U.S. to
            approve the removal of Silvio Berlusconi, a previous Italian
            president who would not do as he was told.

              

            Europe's populist leaders have become a thorn in the side of the EU.
            Hungary's leader, Viktor Orban, is accused of being anti-democratic,
            however, he was recently elected with a two-thirds majority in a
            national election. Many of his nationalistic policies are not
            acceptable to the EU, however, they are popular with a majority of
            Hungarians, especially those who want to limit immigration. The
            implication is that Orban is misleading the Hungarian people and
            they are too stupid or racist to notice. The question is whether
            Hungarians need the approval of the EU to run their country the way
            they want to.

              

            Muller argues that in Europe and the United States it is less
            educated white males that are attracted to populism. For some
            reason, their views don't seem to count. The reviews on the dust
            jacket agree that Muller has brilliant insights, but he does not
            seem to understand that populism grows when elites are out of touch.
            The EU's problem is that it is not willing to listen to its people's
            concerns. The EU wants a federal Europe but many of its citizens
            don't. Muller fears the return of totalitarianism, but what seems
            more likely is the break-up of the EU.

            香港公營醫院爆滿和人手不足的長期問題，成為近日輿論焦點。有醫生明言，若不叫停持單程證來港的內地移民，只會大增公營醫院負荷。一方面，醫護界強調醫者一視同仁，提出單程證問題並非鼓勵歧視內地移民；另一邊廂，有民間團體發起聯署並召開記者會，要求政府減少單程證來港人士數量，紓解香港醫療和資源壓力。


            中國內地來港移民的爭議，已持續了 20
            年。支持和反對內地移民來港的香港市民，分歧不僅在於移民政策配套，也在文化身分認同和意識形態分野。支持內地移民權益者，往往被譏諷為「大愛左膠」；反對移民來港者，則不時被冠上「右翼民粹」的標籤。


            關於自由左翼和民粹右翼的論爭，在近年學術界相當蓬勃。幾個月前，兩位學者 Roger Eatwell 和 Matthew Goodwin
            便撰寫了一本入門讀物《國族民粹主義：反抗自由民主》，以歐洲右翼政黨崛起、英國脫歐公投和美國特朗普上台為例，解說以國家利益和文化為先的國族民粹主義為何興起、如何發展。


            兩位作者認為，國族民粹主義不止是因為嘩眾取寵的政治領袖得以大行其道，而是有更深的 4
            個結構因素：第一是來自民眾對朝野政客和現有政治制度的不信任（distrust）；第二，來自民眾焦慮外來移民會改變國族結構穩定性，繼而摧毀國民經歷史建構的身分認同以至生活方式（destruction）；第三是經濟全球化造成的收入財富不平等，令民眾飽受剝削（deprivation）
            ；第四是民眾與傳統政黨愈加疏離，政黨和民眾的連結逐步消散（de-alignment）。這4個因素，造就了一批民眾 —
            自認在政治上毫無話語權、感到移民潮衝擊主流族群而威脅國族文化和生活方式、不滿新自由主義經濟制度加劇剝削與不平等，更無法繼續認同長期支持的傳統政黨和政治領袖。


            值得留意的是，支持國族民粹的民眾其實相當支持民主，甚至要更多的民主，希望透過直接民主如公投，令更多政客能同情地聆聽和理解民眾聲音，「讓權力歸於人民」而非建制的政治和經濟精英。國族民粹主義者認為主流精英不可信，是因為他們往往迴避國民身分認同與移民衝擊的問題，甚至反過來指斥這些民眾是法西斯主義者和種族主義者。國族民粹主義者對於自由派的中產專業人士將移民問題、少數族群權利和自由貿易，視為不證自明、理所當然的態度，也是嗤之以鼻。國族民粹主義者重視解說政治信念多於客觀經濟數據，在大選投票時也不計較成敗得失和政策成本，只欲透過選票確立一系列價值信念，例如是「國家高於國際」、「振作國民身分」、「穩定大於一切」和「民眾大於精英」的信念，重奪政治話語權。


            兩位作者分析，在國族民粹風潮下，西方政黨政治已逐步「向」右轉。即使極右政黨在歐美尚未執政，但傳統的主流保守政黨，也漸進地採納國族民粹主義者的政治議程，畢竟，它們易於連結純粹關心社會秩序和移民問題的選民。作者們認為，提倡社會民主主義的中間偏左政黨，需要有新思維和手法進入國族民粹主義者關心的議題，甚至要考慮作出短期的政策讓步，避免進一步流失選民支持。以移民政策為例，酌量收緊入境限制和讓高技術及從事公共服務的移工享優先移民資格，不一定和進步左翼政治相違；但將問題簡化為支持開放邊境，讓任何人都能遷移入籍與否的立場問題，更會令政黨的支持者剩下少數的左翼信徒。


            筆者因篇幅所限，難以詳細分析《國》一書其他精彩之處。但讀者也許更關心，兩位作者的觀點是否能套用在香港的處境。《國》一書對民粹主義政治發展的描述，和香港「本土主義」興起有不少相近之處，尤其是經濟不平等和朝野政治精英表現引來民眾反感等。然而，歐美國族民粹主義生於民主的土壤，民眾始終能透過選舉政治影響執政黨，民粹政黨也有機會藉選舉上台執政，受主流監察制衡。但在香港，不論民眾抱持何種政治信念，選舉政治和政黨政治對關乎中國大陸的政策幾近無話語權。在一國權力結構下，即使多番提倡削減單程證配額，香港政府一日無審批權，中國大陸一日不回應香港訴求，也無法改變移民政策，以及民眾對這議題的想像。


            兩位作者結語時指，主流政黨和社會需要找到新的進路和視角去辯論移民政策改革，否則國族民粹主義只會更氾濫。回到香港，應否叫停移民以減輕公共醫療系統負荷？右翼和左翼政團有沒有鬆動倡議的空間？這既是牽涉客觀數據的事實問題，也是包括主觀身分認同和社會願景的價值問題，更是政府能否有權管控移民來往遷徙的政治問題。儘管政治現實上「權不在民」，但至少具體、貼地的辯論，能夠刺激民間的思維，鬆動政治精英的意識形態框框，為同樣無權無勢的左右兩翼陣營「興橋搭路」，推進建設性的對話。


            筆者並非在此要對支持或反對叫停內地移民的觀點作道德判斷，只是想指出，這現象正在呼應蔓延全球的國族民粹主義。為政者如繼續走舊路應對民眾的不滿，只會帶來更大的社會矛盾，也令民眾愈來愈討厭政治和在朝在野的政治精英。

▌所有權力皆來自人民，但何處是它的去向？ ——德國劇作家｜貝托爾特•布萊希特（Bertolt Brecht）▌

——當民粹主義浪潮成為席捲世界的海嘯—— 民粹到底是民主最正統的聲音？還是民主面臨的最大危機？

◤充滿政治激情與煽動口號的民粹時代降臨◢

美國總統川普、英國脫歐領袖法拉奇、法國反移民大將勒龐、

前委瑞內拉總統查維茲、土耳其總統艾爾多安——民粹領袖在世界各地崛起。

但我們真的了解民粹主義嗎？為何它是如此迷人又危險的存在？

每一個批評體制內菁英的人，就應該被稱為民粹主義者嗎？民粹政治行動者都是右派嗎？民粹主義讓政府更接近民眾？「真正的人民」到底是誰，誰又可以為人民發聲？在自由民主制度正面對風起雲湧挑戰的當下，探究這些問題從未像現在這麼具有急迫性。

由普林斯頓大學政治學教授——揚—威爾納‧穆勒（Jan-Werner Müller）所撰寫的《解讀民粹主義》（WHAT IS POPULISM?）以歷史為基礎，援引拉丁美洲、歐洲與美國的例子，定義了民粹主義的特徵，以及探索民粹主義在我們這個時代之所以能勝出的更深層原因：民粹主義者的樣貌究竟為何？使用怎樣的政治語言？掌權後會有哪些典型作為？又該如何對抗民粹主義者並與其對話？作者穆勒主張，民粹主義的核心就是反對多元主義。民粹主義者總是會宣稱，他們（而且只有他們）代表人民以及人民的真正利益。他也說明，和傳統觀點相反，民粹主義者可以根據他們是人民獨家的道德代表而執政；如果民粹主義者擁有足夠的權力，最後將建立一個威權國家，並排除所有不被認為是適當「人民」一分子的人。

現今的民粹主義者正嘗試運用符合民主價值的政治語言，實現一個公然反對民主的政治理想。透過《解讀民粹主義》書中極具啟發性的論點，我們不僅可以認識民粹對民主制度的威脅為何，並促使大家反思該如何修正失能的民主代議制度。自由民主人士究竟該如何應對民粹主義者，特別是在當他們宣稱專為「沉默的多數」或「真正的人民」而發聲的時候。本書不僅為讀者釐清民粹主義的樣貌和特徵，也幫助讀者進一步理解這個民粹主義當道的時代。
