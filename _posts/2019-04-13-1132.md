YOU’RE STILL THE SAME: WHY THEORIES OF POWER HOLD OVER TIME AND ACROSS CONTEXTS  
你仍旧一样：为什么权力理论放之四海跨越古今而皆准

摘要：  
Changes in the values and careers of particularly younger employees and changes in  
organizations, including the reduction of hierarchical levels and greater use of teams  
and matrix structures—combined with new communication technologies and more  
social networking—have produced calls for new organization theories for these new  
realities. Using organizational power and influence as a focus, I argue that fundamental  
theoretical processes remain largely unchanged in their explanatory power, in part  
because such phenomena can be linked to survival advantages. The new workers–new  
work arguments are consistent with the continuing emphasis on novelty and theoretical  
innovation in the organization sciences, an emphasis that, while promulgated in  
virtually all the journals, may poorly serve the development of reliable and valid  
knowledge and hinder our ability to provide useful advice for both organizations and  
their employees.
