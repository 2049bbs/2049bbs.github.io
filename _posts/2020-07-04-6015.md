            Dear Mr./Ms./（头衔） \[Name\],


            My name is XXX. I am writing to urge you to voice for two young
            Chinese COVID-19 activists, who were detained by Beijing police on
            April 19, 2020, held incommunicado for 54 days, and now face trial
            on criminal charges after sharing censored coronavirus materials on
            crowdsourcing site Github. If convicted they could face up to seven
            years in prison.


            Their stories have been covered by multiple media outlets worldwide
            such as South China Morning Post
            (https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3089002/coronavirus-chinese-activists-held-posting-censored-articles),
            New York Times
            (https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/04/world/asia/china-coronavirus-answers.html),
            Daily Mail
            (https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8261025/Three-Beijing-activists-missing-preserving-virus-articles-online.html),
            and Sky News Australia
            (https://www.skynews.com.au/details/\_6160626747001). Organizations
            such as Amnesty International
            (https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa17/2289/2020/en/),
            Reporters without Borders
            (https://rsf.org/en/news/covid-19-six-chinese-defenders-press-freedom-still-detention)
            and Front Line Defenders
            (https://www.frontlinedefenders.org/en/case/right-information-defenders-detained-undisclosed-location-0)
            have also called for their release.


            Cai and Chen were contributors to a crowd-sourced Github project
            known as Terminus2049, which aims at overcoming China's censorship
            by preserving censored news content. Since the COVID-19 outbreak in
            China, they have collected and archived around 100 articles related
            to the pandemic, with topics ranging from leaked documents to
            deleted news. On April 19, 2020, Cai and Chen were arrested on
            charges of “picking quarrels and stirring up trouble”, an accusation
            often used against political activists in China. For 54 days they
            had been kept under “residential surveillance in a designated
            location (RSDL)”, a term that refers to China’s “secret prisons.”
            Detainees under RSDL are deprived of their legal rights such as
            access to attorneys, and face high risks of tortures and
            ill-treatment.


            After two months' secret detention, Cai and Chen were formally
            arrested on 6/12. Beijing police told their families that the two
            volunteers had "voluntarily applied for free legal aid" and had each
            been appointed two lawyers, despite the fact that their family had
            long hired their own lawyers. In China, defendants under arrest for
            criminal charges can only be visited by their legal representatives
            (maximum two), and thus the volunteers were effectively denied any
            communication with their families or access to trusted legal aid.
            The government-appointed lawyers were often used in cases against
            political activists to ensure that the police and prosecutors have
            full control of the case.


            Cai graduated from one of China's top university, Tsinghua
            University, with a master's degree in sociology; and Chen graduated
            from South China Agricultural University. They had volunteered in
            multiple non-profit organizations focused on education and public
            welfare. Since 2018, Cai and Chen had been fighting in the frontline
            for the freedom of speech and press in China. Some of their earliest
            work was related to the #MeToo movement against sexual harassment,
            but they have also covered issues such as the eviction of poor
            migrant workers in Beijing. Their crowd-sourced social projects help
            to wake and encourage Chinese both in mainland and oversea to join
            the campaigns against the censorship and propaganda orchestrated by
            the Chinese Communist Party.


            Since the pandemic, there have been more than 3700 COVID-19 related
            arrests made in China. With the increasing toll from COVID-19 we
            have seen first hand the costs of censorship from the CCP in the
            lives of innocent people all over the world. U.S. Assistant
            Secretary Robert Destro voiced for Chen and Cai on twitter
            (https://twitter.com/DRL\_AS/status/1255239304986624002) and called
            it "shameful" to arrest and detain people who try to share
            information about COVID-19. "What is the CCP so afraid they might
            uncover?" He asked, "We need transparency to fight this pandemic
            together." United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights
            Michelle Bachelet also expressed her concerns about the suppression
            of freedom of expression in China during the COVID-19 outbreak,
            including the detaining of Cai Wei and Chen Mei
            (https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=25920&LangID=E).
            This isn’t a matter of politics, this is a matter of basic human
            rights.


            Please help voice for the Cai and Chen, defenders of freedom of
            press and speech in this time of pandemic, when the transparency of
            information can make the difference between life and death. Please
            ask Beijing to reveal their latest conditions, let them see their
            family's hired lawyers, and help them to avoid further restriction
            of freedom and torture.


            Thank you very much!


            Sincerely,


            \[Your Name\]

官方强行给他（指陈玫）指派了 #北京市中洲律师事务所 的两名律师，使得我为他聘请的梁小军律师无法介入案件。而这两名指派律师玩失踪，我现在根本联系不到他们。做法律援助做成小偷小摸，也算是中共国的盛世奇景了！如果这家律所退出 #陈玫 案件，我也无意追打，你们可以继续好好赚钱。

涉及到 #端点星 案的政府部门和律师事务所，都开始躲猫猫。北京市朝阳区法律援助中心，今天上午在电话里对我说，会去帮我查询和了解 #南波 #邢琦 两名律师代理 #陈玫 案件的情况，今天下午答复我。然而今天都快下班了，我也没收到答复。我主动打电话过去，直接被挂断。010-85963226, 010-85965196.

刚刚给联合国人权高专办的「促进和保护意见和表达自由权」特别报告员 David Kaye 先生 @[davidakaye](/member/davidakaye) 发出英文邮件，请他关注 #端点星 案。

6月3日，联合国人权高专办高级专员 @[mbachelet](/member/mbachelet) 女士在一篇文章当中专门提及此案件。文章链接：https://www.ohchr.org/CH/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=25920&LangID=C
