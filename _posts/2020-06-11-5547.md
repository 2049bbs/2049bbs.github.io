当天行动的公视新闻报导

![](https://www.socialism.org.tw/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/%E5%8F%8D%E5%B0%8D%E7%BE%8E%E5%9C%8B%E5%8F%8A%E9%A6%99%E6%B8%AF%E8%AD%A6%E5%AF%9F%E6%9A%B4%E5%8A%9B6.jpg)

美国明尼阿波尼斯的警察杀死非洲裔人George Floyd，掀起全国反对警察暴力的抗争运动。在英国、德国、比利时以至香港都有声援行动。国际社会主义前进在此表达国际团结！

美国警察种族歧视及极端暴力并不是第一天發生的事。早在2014年以来有多宗美国黑人被警察无辜谋杀，而凶手往往被司法制度包庇，被判无罪释放，长期积累群众怨愤至今爆發。至今官方的验尸报告甚至强调George Floyd有心脏病、体内疑似有毒素等，企图为凶杀案涂脂抹粉。

川普派出警察及军队，动用催泪弹、胡椒弹和橡胶子弹镇压示威者，连记者、长者及儿童都无辜受伤，其恐怖手段与中共独裁治下的港警无异。

就像中共抹黑香港民主运动为「港独势力」所發动的一样，川普也抹黑美国抗争为「本土恐怖组织」ANTIA背后策划。但ANTIFA根本没有扮演任何角色！美国主流媒体就像中共官媒报导香港抗议一样，无限放大示威者的「暴力」，却为最大的国家恐怖暴力粉饰太平。所谓的民主国家与习近平独裁政权一样，只会以暴力及谎言压制群众的反抗声音！

美国警察暴力与种族歧视问题，不是由于个别警察的失误，而是由资本主义制度滋生的。无论是司法制度和执法机关都充斥美国白人至上主义，往往将黑人定性为「罪犯」。美国黑人男性一辈子中入狱服刑的可能性是白人的三倍。

全美新冠肺炎大流行揭露了川普政府的无能，起初为了经济数字而淡化疫情，而医疗系统的私有化更令富人才可能负担完善医疗，使美国成为全球疫情最严重的国家。由于居住条件恶劣和欠缺医疗保障，佔美国总人口13%的黑人死于新冠肺炎的比例却佔到了疫情死亡总数的23%，部分州分的黑人死亡率高达7成。

现在美国经济深陷危机，大量租户被迫迁、社会服务经费被削减、失业人口高达4千万。不论是白人还是黑人，工人和青年都忍够了，唯一出路是团结在这场抗争之中，对抗富人统治的经济制度。

美国的两大党和台湾三大党一样，都是代表财团和权贵的利益，根本就是假民主。在美国，大部分爆發抗争的城市都是由民主党执政的，而民主党选择出动警察镇压示威者。民主党总统候选人拜登呼吁警察不要枪击示威者头部，但枪击手脚是可以的！因此，美国「社会主义替代」（国际社会主义前进在美国姊妹组织）在这场抗争中主张建设挑战美国财团两大党的工人阶级政党。

我们与明尼阿波利斯及纽约市的综合交通工会（ATU ）动员了司机拒载警察及被捕人士到拘留所。我们在西雅图的市议会议员萨旺特（Kshama Sawant）在议会提出动议，禁止警察压颈、禁止使用化学武器、橡胶子弹及声波炮，并削减一半警队预算。我们正在推动美国發动一天的大罢工。

美国政府在六四屠杀三十一週年当天，假惺惺地表示不要忘记北京屠城，自己却派军队镇压抗议。而义正辞严地表示支持香港民主抗争的蔡英文，也对美国反警暴抗争隻字不题。这些领导人真正关心的不是民主权利，而只是为了利用反中辞措收割民意，并在地缘政治斗争中争夺市场利益。捍卫民主权利不能依靠美国和台湾等假民主政府，而需要受压迫群众的团结斗争。我们呼吁中港台与美国的抗争互相声援，只有打倒中美台以至世界的资本主义制度，才可以结束种族歧视、暴力和剥削！

国际社会主义前进主张：

中美政府一丘之貉，打倒美国及香港警察暴力！

惩罚四名杀人警察，解散并重组警队，由工会及社区委员会民主监督！

削减警队预算一半，公帑用于建设公共住房和学校！

工人阶级团结斗争，消灭製造种族歧视的资本主义制度！

Black Lives Matter! Workers of the World Unite! Fight Police Brutality in US and HK!

The murder of George Floyd by the Minneapolis police in the United States set off a nationwide protest movement against police brutality. Solidarity protests also took place in the U.K., Germany, Belgium. We International Socialist Forward are here today in Taiwan to show our solidarity with the US masses!

It is not the first racist violence by the US police. Since 2014, many black Americans and people of colour have been murdered in cold blood by the police. Yet the murderers have often been acquitted by the judicial system. Now the public anger that have accumulated for years has erupted and bursted into mass protests. Until now, the police autopsy report even emphasizes that George Floyd has heart disease and drugs in his body, attempting to disatract public attention away from the murder.

Trump sent in police and troops which used tear gas, pepper and rubber bullets against protesters. Even journalists, elderly and children were targeted. These terrorist methods are the same as those of the Hong Kong police under the CCP dictatorship.

Similar to how the CCP put the blame of the Hong Kong democracy movement on “Hong Kong independence forces”, Trump also attacked the protests now in the US for being instigated by the “terrorist organization” ANTIA. But ANTIFA played no real role at all! Just like what the state media of CCP did to Hong Kong protests, the mainstream capitalist media in the US outrageously magnified the “violence” of the demonstrators, ignoring the the biggest terrorist violence now which is the state itself. The so-called democratic US is now doing the same thing as what Xi Jinping’s dictatorship did, attacking people’s resistance with violence and lies!

The issues of police brutality and racism in the US are not about actions by individual policemen, but the capitalist system as a whole. Both the judicial system and law enforcement agency in US are plagued by white supremacism, and often see blacks as “criminals.” Black people are three times more likely to end up in prison than whites.

The pandemic has exposed the impotence of Trump’s government. At first, the pandemic was downplayed for economic reasons, and after it became a full blown pandemic the privatization of the medical system made it only possible for rich people to afford complete medical care, making the United States the country with the worst-hit by the pandemic in the world. While black people account for 13% of the total population of the United States, due to poverty and lack of public medical services, blacks account for 23% of the total deaths from COVID-19. The death rate of black people in some states is as high as 70%.

the US economy is also in a deep crisis, many tenants face eviction, social service funding has been severely cut, and up to 40 million people are unemployed. Workers and youth, both black and white, have suffered enough. The only way out is to be united in this struggle against the economic system dominated by the rich.

The two major parties in the United States, like the three main parties in Taiwan, represent the interests of elites and big companies, none of them stand for democracy. In the United States, most of the cities where mass protests broke out had Democratic Party governments, and the Democratic Party chose to mobilize the police to attack the demonstrators. Democratic Party presidential candidate Biden called on the police not to shoot demonstrators in the heads and hearts, but instead shoot then in their hands and feet! Our sister organization in the US “Socialist Alternative” are participating n this struggle to build a party of working class that can challenge the two major parties of the American capitalism.

Together with Minneapolis and the New York City Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU), we organised drivers to refuse carrying arrested protesters for the police. Our city council member Kshama Sawant in Seattle filed a motion in the City Council to ban the police from using chemical weapons, rubber bullets and sonic guns, and to cut the police budget by half. We are also fighting for a nationwide one-day strike in the United States.

On the 31st anniversary of the June 4th Tainanmen massacre, the US government hypocritically said that we would not forget the Massacre, but at the same time sent its own troops to attack the protest.ls. Tsai Ing-wen, who solemnly expressed her support for the democratic struggle in Hong Kong, said nothing about the US protests. What these leaders really care about is not democratic rights, they only use anti-China rhetoric to win public support in order to strengthen their position to compete for market interests in the geopolitical imperialist conflicts. We cannot rely on fake democratic governments such as the United States and Taiwan governments to defend democratic rights. What is required is united struggle by the oppressed people all over the world. We call on workers and masses in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and the United States to stand in solidarity with each other. Only by overthrowing the capitalist system in China, the United States, Taiwan and the world can we end racist discrimination, violence and exploitation!

International Socialist Forward stand for:

• No support to both Chinese and American Governments. Fight police brutality in both the United States and Hong Kong.

• Indict all four police responsible for Gerge Floyd’s murder, restructure and reorganize the police force along democratic lines under the control of trade unions and community committees.

• Cut the police budget by half and use those public funds to build public housing and schools.

• Working class of the world unite! Fight to overthrow the capitalist system that creates racism.
