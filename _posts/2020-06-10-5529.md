            以下根据BE4的原模版改写。改动比较多，主要着重于COVID-19。


            可以考虑发的对象：议员，政治人物，大众媒体人物，人权机构人物，尤其是关注COVID、中国话题、人权和言论自由的。


            以下是模板，可以使用真名，也可以假名（如一个随机英文名），重点在于传递信息、引起关注：


            Dear Mr./Ms. \[Name\],


            My name is XXX. I am writing to urge you to voice for two young
            Chinese COVID-19 activists, who were detained by Beijing police on
            April 19, 2020, and had been held incommunicado ever since, after
            sharing censored coronavirus materials on crowdsourcing site Github.


            Their stories have been covered by multiple media outlets such as
            New York Times
            (https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/04/world/asia/china-coronavirus-answers.html),
            Daily Mail
            (https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8261025/Three-Beijing-activists-missing-preserving-virus-articles-online.html),
            and Sky News Australia
            (https://www.skynews.com.au/details/\_6160626747001). Organizations
            such as Amnesty International
            (https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa17/2289/2020/en/) and
            Reporters without Borders
            (https://rsf.org/en/news/china-detained-fighting-censorship) have
            also called for their release.


            Cai and Chen were contributors to a crowd-sourced Github project
            known as Terminus2049, which aims at overcoming China's censorship
            by preserving censored news content. Since the COVID-19 outbreak in
            China, they have collected and archived around 100 articles related
            to the pandemic, with topics ranging from leaked documents to
            deleted news. On April 19, 2020, Cai and Chen were arrested on
            charges of “picking quarrels and stirring up trouble”, an accusation
            often used against political activists in China. Since then, they
            had been kept under “residential surveillance in a designated
            location (RSDL)”, a term that refers to China’s “secret prisons.”
            Detainees under RSDL are deprived of their legal rights such as
            access to attorneys, and face high risks of tortures and
            ill-treatment.


            Cai graduated from one of China's top university, Tsinghua
            University, with a master's degree in sociology; and Chen graduated
            from South China Agricultural University. They have both volunteered
            in multiple non-profit organizations focused on education and public
            welfare. Since 2018, Cai and Chen had been fighting in the frontline
            for the freedom of speech and press in China. Their crowd-sourced
            social projects help to wake and encourage tens of thousands of
            Chinese both in mainland and oversea to join the campaigns against
            the censorship and propaganda orchestrated by the Chinese Communist
            Party.


            Since the pandemic, there have been more than 3700 COVID-19 related
            arrests made in China. With the increasing toll from COVID-19 we
            have seen first hand the costs of censorship from the CCP in the
            lives of innocent people all over the world. U.S. Assistant
            Secretary Robert Destro voiced for Chen and Cai on twitter
            (https://twitter.com/DRL\_AS/status/1255239304986624002) and called
            it "shameful" to arrest and detain people who try to share
            information about COVID-19. "What is the CCP so afraid they might
            uncover?" He asked, "We need transparency to fight this pandemic
            together." This isn’t a matter of politics, this is a matter of
            basic human rights.


            Therefore, I urge you, please voice for the Cai and Chen, calling
            Beijing to reveal their detained location and latest conditions, let
            them see their family and attorneys, and help them to avoid further
            restriction of freedom and torture.


            Thank you very much!


            Sincerely,


            \[Your Name\]

【清华毕业混的最差的，现在怎么样了？】 我的朋友，清华社会学硕士毕业。现被秘密关押，已52天。他本可以做着数据工程师的工作，养两只猫，安稳生活。但他参与了 #端点星 计划，保存微信微博的404文章，只为了这些互联网记忆不被消失。这就是清华最有理想的人的遭遇，你说他聪明还是傻？
