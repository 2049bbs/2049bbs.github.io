Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.18% is considering moving 15% to 30% of its production capacity from China to Southeast Asia, according to a report from the Nikkei Asian Review, which said that the company has asked its suppliers to look into the costs of such a move. The story, which cites unnamed sources, said that trade tensions between the U.S. and China have Apple considering whether to shift some of its production outside of China but that the company may not turn back on its plans even if the trade disputes were settled since Apple sees heightened risks from its reliance on Chinese manufacturing. Apple declined to comment in the Nikkei Asian Review's report. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said that "in a best-case scenario," Apple would likely be able to shift 5% to 7% of its iPhone production to India within 12 to 18 months. "Moving 15% of its iPhone production from China to other regions (India and Vietnam would be top candidates) would take at least two to three years in our opinion given the complexity and logistics involved in such a gargantuan endeavor and clearly have its share of risks (e.g., supply chain disruption, higher costs)," he wrote. Apple shares have gained 29% so far this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.20% has climbed 14% in that time.

有消息说苹果正在考虑从中国转出15%-30%的产能至东南亚.

几个点

1.  美国的公司开始考虑, 或者一些公司正在转移产业链, 这代表了贸易战有很大可能性并不是短暂的一个事件.
    
2.  中国有上百万人靠着组装这些新科技吃饭. 苹果是产业龙头, 也许会带动一批公司离开. 根据一些消息来看中国现在已经有失业潮了. 这会让失业人口进一步上升.
    
3.  对外贸易减少, 外汇压力增加. 人民币贬值可能性很大.
    
4.  政治经济一系列的不稳定会导致各种可怕的事件.
    

我觉得国内能出来的朋友们就赶紧出来吧. 如果不能出来也换点外汇, 美元日元什么的.
