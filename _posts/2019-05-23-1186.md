            作者说的没错，中国在贸易战中打响了第一枪，以保护主义有效地将美国大公司拒之门外，而中国在美国的扩张却毫无节制。如果这一进程不受限制地继续下去，中国肯定会取代美国成为世界强国。中国是一个威权国家，核心价值观与美国相左。因此，风险是再高不过的了，而现在很可能是美国对中国拥有足够影响力的最后一次，能够真正占据上风。(从iliketosleep)

            while China's expansion into the US went on unrestrained.

            这我觉得倒不是。华为不也一直没进入美国市场吗？把这里的 US 替换成 the rest of the world 我觉得还差不多。

> The author is correct in saying that China fired the first shots in the trade war with effectively shutting out major US companies with its protectionism, while China's expansion into the US went on unrestrained. If this process continued on unchecked, China would definitely replace the US as the world power. China is an authoritarian state, with core values that are at odds with the US. Therefore, the stakes could not be higher, and now could very well be the last time that the US has enough leverage over China to actually come out on top.(FROM iliketosleep)
