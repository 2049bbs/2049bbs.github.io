            Whenever you feel like criticizing any one, just remember that all
            the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve
            had.——_The Great Gatsby_

            “Most men die at twenty or thirty; thereafter they are only
            reflections of themselves: for the rest of their lives they are
            aping themselves, repeating from day to day more and more
            mechanically and affectedly what they said and did and thought and
            loved when they were alive.”
