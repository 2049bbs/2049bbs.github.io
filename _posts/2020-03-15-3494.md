            The signatories also criticised comments made by Sir Patrick
            Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser, about managing
            the spread of the infection to make the population immune.


            The Department of Health said Sir Patrick's comments had been
            misinterpreted.


            Their letter was published on the day it was announced 10 more
            people in the UK have died after testing positive for coronavirus,
            bringing the total number of deaths to 21.


            英国都这么紧张了吗，最近又有10人死亡，一共死了21个。大陆这边不知道什么情况，说是零增长，但是我听消息，我家附近就可能有人感染。

            "It is almost impossible to predict what that will mean in terms of
            human costs, but we are conservatively looking at tens of thousands
            of deaths, and possibly at hundreds of thousands of deaths," he
            said.

            My heart is with British people. I really hope that this will not
            last long.
