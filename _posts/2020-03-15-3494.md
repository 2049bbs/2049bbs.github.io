            The signatories also criticised comments made by Sir Patrick
            Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser, about managing
            the spread of the infection to make the population immune.


            The Department of Health said Sir Patrick's comments had been
            misinterpreted.


            Their letter was published on the day it was announced 10 more
            people in the UK have died after testing positive for coronavirus,
            bringing the total number of deaths to 21.


            英国都这么紧张了吗，最近又有10人死亡，一共死了21个。大陆这边不知道什么情况，说是零增长，但是我听消息，我家附近就可能有人感染。

            "It is almost impossible to predict what that will mean in terms of
            human costs, but we are conservatively looking at tens of thousands
            of deaths, and possibly at hundreds of thousands of deaths," he
            said.

            My heart is with British people. I really hope that this will not
            last long.

            这种解读也有，但是不符合执政党的利益。虽然英国政府的这番表态确实把英国人吓得半死，客观上降低了 $R\_0$，但是执政党基本完蛋。

            有人说，要是约翰逊直接宣布禁止大规模活动啥的，英国人直接反了，天天游行，索性直接说大家伙儿自求多福，大家反而老实了……

            Theresa May: My right honourable friend is rightly engrossed in the
            day to day in dealing with the results of Covid-19. But I'd like to
            ask him to cast his mind a little further forward. The chief
            scientific adviser and the chief medical officer have been clear
            that the best solution for this is a vaccine but the chief
            scientific adviser has said that could be as much as a year away. I
            believe he's also suggested that until that vaccine is available it
            may be difficult to ease restrictions successfully. Does my right
            honourable friend agree with that analysis?


            Boris Johnson: The objective of the government and our scientific
            advisers is to press the peak of the epidemic to make sure we get
            through so that we come out on the other side and that we do that as
            fast as possible. That's why we're taking all the measures that
            we're announcing, that's why we've announced the package of business
            support that we have. I'm not going to give a timescale on it but
            that is the strategy and I'm absolutely certain that it will
            succeed.
