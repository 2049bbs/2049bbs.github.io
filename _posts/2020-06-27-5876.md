            “端点星”陈玫家属拒绝第二批官派律师


            （这配图……把我放在他们俩中间，让人以为我也被抓了呢。没有没有，我没有被抓，他们只是截取了我昨天视频中的影像而已。）

            #陈玫 家属和律师联合声明：家属早在4月就为陈玫聘请律师，不需要任何形式的法律援助律师和指派律师。


            派给陈玫的第一批律师已经被我们逼退。第二批律师来自：【北京市中洲律师事务所】。如果有人认识这家律所的人，请帮忙传话，陈玫早就有律师，不需要法律援助。

            英文版情况介绍，可以用于英文论坛传播，基于之前的一系列发信模板（https://2049bbs.xyz/t/4636，https://2049bbs.xyz/t/5741）。


            Two young Chinese COVID-19 activists, Cai Wei and Chen Mei, after
            sharing censored coronavirus materials on crowdsourcing site Github,
            were detained by Beijing police on April 19, 2020, held
            incommunicado for 54 days, and now face trial on criminal charges of
            "picking quarrels and stirring up trouble". If convicted they can
            face up to seven years in prison.


            Cai and Chen were contributors to a crowd-sourced Github project
            known as Terminus2049 (https://terminus2049.github.io/), which aims
            at overcoming China's censorship by preserving censored news
            content. Since the COVID-19 outbreak in China, they have collected
            and archived around 100 articles related to the pandemic, with
            topics ranging from leaked documents to deleted news. On April 19,
            2020, Cai and Chen were arrested on charges of “picking quarrels and
            stirring up trouble”, an accusation often used against political
            activists in China. For 54 days they had been kept under
            “residential surveillance in a designated location (RSDL)”, a term
            that refers to China’s “secret prisons.” Detainees under RSDL are
            deprived of their legal rights such as access to attorneys, and
            often endure tortures and ill-treatment.


            After two months' secret detention, Cai and Chen were formally
            arrested on 6/12. If convicted they could each face up to seven
            years in prison. Beijing police told their families that the two
            volunteers had "voluntarily applied for free legal aid" and each of
            them had been appointed two lawyers. In China, defendants under
            arrest for criminal charges can only be visited by their legal
            representatives (maximum two), and thus the volunteers were
            effectively denied communication with their families or access to
            the families' hired lawyers. The government-appointed lawyers were
            often used in cases against political activists to ensure that the
            police and prosecutors have full control of the case.


            Cai graduated from one of China's top university, Tsinghua
            University, with a master's degree in sociology; and Chen graduated
            from South China Agricultural University. They had volunteered in
            multiple non-profit organizations focused on education and public
            welfare. Since 2018, Cai and Chen had been fighting in the frontline
            for the freedom of speech and press in China. Some of their earliest
            work was related to the #MeToo movement against sexual harassment,
            but they have also covered issues such as the eviction of poor
            migrant workers in Beijing. Their crowd-sourced social projects help
            to wake and encourage tens of thousands of Chinese both in mainland
            and oversea to join the campaigns against the censorship and
            propaganda orchestrated by the Chinese Communist Party.


            Since the pandemic, there have been more than 3700 COVID-19 related
            arrests made in China. With the increasing toll from COVID-19 we
            have seen first hand the costs of censorship from the CCP in the
            lives of innocent people all over the world. United Nations High
            Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet expressed her
            concerns about the suppression of freedom of expression in China
            during the COVID-19 outbreak, including the detaining of Cai Wei and
            Chen Mei
            (https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=25920&LangID=E).
            U.S. Assistant Secretary Robert Destro voiced for Chen and Cai on
            twitter (https://twitter.com/DRL\_AS/status/1255239304986624002) and
            called it "shameful" to arrest and detain people who try to share
            information about COVID-19. "What is the CCP so afraid they might
            uncover?" He asked, "We need transparency to fight this pandemic
            together." This isn’t a matter of politics, this is a matter of
            basic human rights.


            Please help voice for the Cai and Chen, defenders of freedom of
            press and speech in this time of pandemic, when the transparency of
            information can make the difference between life and death. Please
            ask Beijing to reveal their latest conditions, let them see their
            family's hired lawyers, and help them to avoid further restriction
            of freedom and torture.


            Thank you very much!


            FYI, Chen and Cai's stories have been covered by multiple media
            outlets worldwide such as South China Morning Post
            (https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3089002/coronavirus-chinese-activists-held-posting-censored-articles),

            (https://www.frontlinedefenders.org/en/case/right-information-defenders-detained-undisclosed-location-0)
            have also called for their release.

“在我的记忆里，#蔡伟 一直在物质享受上追求不大，初中时我们都是从各个小村子里出来的，穿着布鞋互相也攀比不了什么，到了高中，看着同学穿耐克阿迪时，自卑感攀比心爆棚，买不起就找父亲要钱买安踏特步，而小伟仍然是简朴的打扮，丝毫不在乎穿着饮食，这是我很佩服他的一点”

好友发文回忆蔡伟往事：为省钱买书拌老干妈吃白米饭，熬夜打手电看书看到被班主任威胁退学。

我们需要有更多这样的关于两人的平凡叙事，他们值得被更多人看见、认识、珍惜。你眼中的 #蔡伟、#陈玫 又是什么样子的？来留言说说吧。

明天我会再发视频，好好梳理一下 #陈玫 和 #蔡伟 被强行指派律师当中的猫腻。

有些所谓理中客的先生，说什么法律援助律师也不一定就会配合警方之类的话。

那我就问一个很简单的问题：既然这样，为什么不让家属聘请的律师介入案件？非得折腾半天去浪费纳税人的钱，搞什么法律援助。

毫不意外，我们和律师的联合声明，那段80秒的视频，在墙内也被封杀。越是封杀，越说明你这官派律师的行为有鬼啊，越说明你们想用官派律师来害人啊！所以就不要假惺惺说什么「法律援助律师」，真侮辱「援助」二字！妈的，好词儿都被共匪给毁了！

昨天半夜，我睡眼矇眬地带小妞上厕所。有那么一瞬间，在寂静的夜晚里，看着昏黄的灯光，忽然想起被监视居住的时候。

**刚被关进军事基地监视居住时，连续好几天不许睡觉，没有饭吃，忘了有没有水喝。长时间站着，偶尔可以坐着，困了就冷水洗脸。眼睛疼得难受，高度近视的我，一度怀疑自己快瞎了。**

我没有被关过看守所，不知其中滋味。但我老婆进过北京一看，我听她说起过里面许多事。

昨晚那一瞬间，我除了想起自己的经历，还想起此刻正在朝阳看守所的 #陈玫 ，不知他被安排何时值班，是否已经收到我汇给他的钱，是否可以买点零食解馋了？那个地方既然没有自由，那就对自己的肠胃好点吧！

**官派律师换了一批人，听说第二批官派律师已经见过陈玫、签好委托。**第一批律师实际上只待了七个工作日就撤出（6.15-6.23）。这么快地换了官派律师，不知 #陈玫 有没有意识到我们在外面所做的努力。他并没有什么经验，被抓之前肯定也没人给他讲过这些策略。唉！谁能想到他会被抓呀？！

其實我最近有許多想學習也需要學習的知識，但自從陳玫出事，我的這些學習計劃都只能延期。我不知道自己的努力會有多大效果，但總不能坐以待斃。

許多年後，當 #陈玫 結婚生子，他的孩子如果問起我：「大伯啊，當年我爸被共產黨迫害的時候，你做了什麼嗎？」我總不能說自己從一開始就放棄了吧。
