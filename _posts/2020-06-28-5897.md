Lyrics: Don McLean　 (唐‧麥克林)　

Music: Don McLean　 (唐‧麥克林)　

Starry starry night 繁星点点的晚上

Paint your palette blue and grey 调色盘上蓝与灰

Look out on a summer's day 在夏日向外望去

with eyes that know the darkness in my soul 用那洞悉我灵魂幽暗的眼睛

Shadows on the hills 山丘上的阴影

Sketch the trees and the daffodils 描摹树与水仙花

Catch the breeze and the winter chills 捕捉微风与冬天的冷冽

in colors on the snowy linen land 在亚麻的雪地里绘出色彩

Now I understand 如今我才明白

what you tried to say to me 你想对我说什么

How you suffered for your sanity 你是怎样为你的清醒而痛苦

How you tried to set them free 你是怎样想让他们自由

They would not listen they did not know how 但他们不听，也不知如何去听

Perhaps they'll listen now 也许现在，他们会听

Starry starry night 繁星点点的晚上

Flaming flowers that brightly blaze 火焰般的花朵明亮燃烧

Swirling clouds in violet haze 旋转的云有紫罗兰的光泽

Reflect in Vincent's eyes of china blue 倒映在Vincent瓷蓝的双眼中

Colors changing hue 色彩变换色调

Morning fields of amber grain 清晨的田野布满琥珀色的谷物

Weathered faces lined in pain 风霜的脸上疼痛的纹路

Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand 被艺术家的爱意之手抚慰

Now I understand 如今我才明白

what you tried to say to me 你想对我说什么

How you suffered for your sanity 你是怎样为你的清醒而痛苦

How you tried to set them free 你是怎样想让他们自由

They would not listen they did not know how 但他们不听，也不知如何去听

Perhaps they'll listen now 也许现在，他们会听

For they could not love you 因为他们不能爱你

But still your love was true 但你的爱依然真挚

And when no hope was left in sight 当所有的希望都消逝

On that starry, starry night 在那个繁星点点的晚上

You took your life, as lovers often do 你像殉情的恋人一样结束了生命

But I could have told you, Vincent 但愿我能告诉你，Vicent

This world was never meant for one 这个世界配不上一个

As beautiful as you 像你这样美好的人

Starry, starry night 繁星点点的晚上

Portraits hung in empty halls 肖像挂在空荡荡的大厅里

Frameless heads on nameless walls 无框的头挂在在无名的墙上

With eyes that watch the world and can't forget 眼睛看着世界，永不遗忘

Like the strangers that you've met 像你曾遇到的陌生人

The ragged men in the ragged clothes 穿着褴褛衣衫的褴褛人

The silver thorn, a bloody rose 银色的荆棘，血色的玫瑰

Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow 在初雪上静卧，碾碎，断裂

Now I think I know 如今我想我终于明白

What you tried to say to me 你想对我说什么

And how you suffered for your sanity 你是怎样为你的清醒而痛苦

And how you tried to set them free 你是怎样想让他们自由

They would not listen, they're not listening still 但他们不想听，他们仍然不听

Perhaps they never will 也许他们永远不会听
