            Quote:


            For politicians, the striving for power is an unavoidable tool of
            their trade. Thus the ‘power instinct,' as it is often called,
            belongs among their normal attributes. However, the sin against the
            Holy Spirit of their profession begins where this striving for power
            is separated from the matter in hand and becomes an object purely of
            self-intoxication instead of something that enters exclusively into
            the service of their ‘cause.' For ultimately there are only two
            kinds of mortal sin in the field of politics: the lack of commitment
            to a cause and the lack of a sense of responsibility that is often,
            but not always, identical with it. Vanity, the need to thrust
            oneself center stage, is what is most likely to lead the politician
            into the temptation of committing either or both of these sins. All
            the more, as the demagogue is forced to play for ‘effect.' Because
            he is concerned only with the ‘impression' he is making, he always
            runs the risk both of turning into an actor and of taking too
            lightly his responsibility for his own actions. His lack of
            objectivity leads him to strive for the glittering facade of power,
            instead of its reality, while his lack of a sense of responsibility
            seduces him into enjoying power for its own sake, rather than for
            its substantive purpose.
