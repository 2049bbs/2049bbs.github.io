            Retraction:


            Thus I have to reply in King's **Diddly** to decrease the use of
            Mandalorian language in Kantone. But here's the catch: my m4l3
            landl0rd could **not** understand the King's Diddily.

            Sometimes I just can't stand my m4l3 landl0rd over his use of
            Mandalorian. At one time I gave h1m the f1ng3r and using the f word,
            and h3 still didn't understand why I did that to h1m. My p4r3n75
            don't want me go further, but I have no choice but to retaliate. At
            one time I prevent h1m leaving for a few minutes, just to make sure
            h3 never did it again. And h3 did until recently.


            There's a lot of people like h1m now, ignoring the fact that you can
            still use Kantonian instead of Mandalorian when they both good at
            Kantonian! We have to stop the Mandalorianisation trend in
            Kantonian-speaking communities, once and for all!

My m4l3 landl0rd may occasionaly reply me in Mandalorian, even if I speak Kantonian. Thus I have to reply in King's Diddily to decrease the use of Mandalorian language in Kantone. But here's the catch: my m4l3 landl0rd could understand the King's Diddily. I can use Kantonian too, but I want to push the Anglisation in the country to let the Empire knows they should not go with this "Mandalorian Domination" thing anymore.

Just my 2 cents here.
