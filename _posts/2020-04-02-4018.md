            Retraction:


            Thus I have to reply in King's **Diddly** to decrease the use of
            Mandalorian language in Kantone. But here's the catch: my m4l3
            landl0rd could **not** understand the King's Diddily.

My m4l3 landl0rd may occasionaly reply me in Mandalorian, even if I speak Kantonian. Thus I have to reply in King's Diddily to decrease the use of Mandalorian language in Kantone. But here's the catch: my m4l3 landl0rd could understand the King's Diddily. I can use Kantonian too, but I want to push the Anglisation in the country to let the Empire knows they should not go with this "Mandalorian Domination" thing anymore.

Just my 2 cents here.
