            Retraction:


            Thus I have to reply in King's **Diddly** to decrease the use of
            Mandalorian language in Kantone. But here's the catch: my m4l3
            landl0rd could **not** understand the King's Diddily.

            Sometimes I just can't stand my m4l3 landl0rd over his use of
            Mandalorian. At one time I gave h1m the f1ng3r and using the f word,
            and h3 still didn't understand why I did that to h1m. My p4r3n75
            don't want me go further, but I have no choice but to retaliate. At
            one time I prevent h1m leaving for a few minutes, just to make sure
            h3 never did it again. And h3 did until recently.


            There's a lot of people like h1m now, ignoring the fact that you can
            still use Kantonian instead of Mandalorian when they both good at
            Kantonian! We have to stop the Mandalorianisation trend in
            Kantonian-speaking communities, once and for all!

            Today Mr L4ndl0rd said to me that he don't want any Africans to be
            his tenants, plus still ignoring "Kantonians should not speak
            Mandalorian to each other" rules for a bit.


            Too shame. He's gonna be hit by waves of N-word. If I don't mention
            it now, he'll be unprepared.


            But my p4r3n75 are the ones to blame for that, 'cause they said "no"
            first ahead of Mr L4ndl0rd, and they blame me for "tr0ubl3m4k1ng".


            Think of [the
            recent](https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/10/china/africans-guangzhou-china-coronavirus-hnk-intl/index.html)

            if we can't be progressive and spotlighting the minorities and their
            hardships, while keeping then no one will, and the town will turn
            very conservative like the rest of the country! Of course, **local
            languages must be preserved and protected**, and integration is
            needed for the people who(m) work here, but those "Mandalorian Bad
            Hombres" keeps ignoring rules of respecting local cultures, [the
            locals have no
            choice](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010%E5%B9%B4%E5%BB%A3%E5%B7%9E%E5%B8%82%E6%B0%91%E6%8D%8D%E8%A1%9B%E7%B2%B5%E8%AA%9E%E8%A1%8C%E5%8B%95)

My m4l3 landl0rd may occasionaly reply me in Mandalorian, even if I speak Kantonian. Thus I have to reply in King's Diddily to decrease the use of Mandalorian language in Kantone. But here's the catch: my m4l3 landl0rd could understand the King's Diddily. I can use Kantonian too, but I want to push the Anglisation in the country to let the Empire knows they should not go with this "Mandalorian Domination" thing anymore.

Just my 2 cents here.
