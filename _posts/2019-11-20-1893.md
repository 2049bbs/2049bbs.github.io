亲属关系太复杂，没搞懂这个 cousin 到底对应什么……

哈耶克比他小 10 岁，对于这个远亲疯子，很多细腻的观察很有意思。比如对 **truthfulness** 的热忱。

> It meant much more than truth in speech. One had to “live” truth and not tolerate any pretence in oneself or others. It sometimes produced outright rudeness and, certainly, unpleasantness. Every convention was dissected and every conventional form exposed as fraud. Wittgenstein merely carried this further in applying it to himself. I sometimes felt that he took a perverse pleasure in discovering falsehood in his own feelings and that he was constantly trying to purge himself of all fraud.
