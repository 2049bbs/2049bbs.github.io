            First we appreciate your support. It seems you learnt quite a bit of
            Chinese, since most of the articles, as well as the interface
            language is Chinese.


            Please excuse me for saying that, but I still doubt if you are
            really from the US. Just because it's the worst time in 2049bbs: the
            owner has gone missing, lots of Wumaos appeared.


            Just curious how did you find here?

            I understand your skepticism. I would like to start by saying that I
            know absolutely no Chinese, but I am able to understand the posts
            thanks to the insane power of Google Translate (It translate the
            entire web-page for me). I only found out about this website from
            this article:
            https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3081569/chinese-activists-detained-after-sharing-censored-coronavirus
            which talked about Terminus2049 which I then followed to this site.
            I realize that with the founders being arrested this site might
            sadly close down. I would be happy to answer any other questions you
            have about the outside world opinion of what is going on right now.

            Appreciated. Identity doesn't matter, at least to me. We will keep
            this dim light on till the last minute, with or without the
            founders.

            I am curious about the sentiment of you all living in the mainland.
            How do you think the view of the CCP has changed for the average
            mainlander?

            You know we use "skepticism" more in academic writings. Why it seems
            to me your Chinese is even better than your English?

I wish I could properly translate this to you but sadly I think you would have a much easier time translating this to English than I would have translating it to Mandrin. I just wanted to say that it's truly amazing to me to see so many stand up against such scrutiny when there is so much at risk. I wish I had the bravery of you all. I just wanted to let you know that you have the full support of people from around the world and we wish you health and safety on your battle.
