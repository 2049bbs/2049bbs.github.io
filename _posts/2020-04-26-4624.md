            First we appreciate your support. It seems you learnt quite a bit of
            Chinese, since most of the articles, as well as the interface
            language is Chinese.


            Please excuse me for saying that, but I still doubt if you are
            really from the US. Just because it's the worst time in 2049bbs: the
            owner has gone missing, lots of Wumaos appeared.


            Just curious how did you find here?

            I understand your skepticism. I would like to start by saying that I
            know absolutely no Chinese, but I am able to understand the posts
            thanks to the insane power of Google Translate (It translate the
            entire web-page for me). I only found out about this website from
            this article:
            https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3081569/chinese-activists-detained-after-sharing-censored-coronavirus
            which talked about Terminus2049 which I then followed to this site.
            I realize that with the founders being arrested this site might
            sadly close down. I would be happy to answer any other questions you
            have about the outside world opinion of what is going on right now.

            Appreciated. Identity doesn't matter, at least to me. We will keep
            this dim light on till the last minute, with or without the
            founders.

            I am curious about the sentiment of you all living in the mainland.
            How do you think the view of the CCP has changed for the average
            mainlander?

            You know we use "skepticism" more in academic writings. Why it seems
            to me your Chinese is even better than your English?

            If there is any way you could like to verify who I am without
            revealing too much I would be happy to do so.

            @[jwright0080](/member/jwright0080) #8 Thanks for your help, but
            I've verified your link already. It's safe. (Actually that's the
            same link as posted on Pincong article, but I almost forgot lol)

            其实就是南华早报的链接。看来南华早报帮2049拉到了外国友人。 @[jwright0080](/member/jwright0080)
            we now know you're from the SCMP article. would you mind telling us
            which state you're from and what's your opinion on the CCP first?
            such that we can respond with more meaningful answers.

            Broadly speaking, people don't believe the communism as they were,
            but plenty of them still count on CPP to maintain the social
            stability and economic growth.


            I doubt the users of this site (apparently not many) can provide you
            a good sample size or distribution.

            @[jwright0080](/member/jwright0080) I'm also quite curious about
            your opinion on CCP, and Xi Jinping btw.

            Before the epidemic I didn't really have a strong opinion regarding
            the CCP. However, after doing some research and seeing everything
            that has been going on from the lack of information to Hong Kong, I
            have gotten an ever decreasing view on the CCP. I don't want people
            to think that I am against the people of China or the country
            itself, its actually quite the opposite. It hurts me so much to see
            the abuse of rights of their own people by the CCP that I can't but
            despise them (the CCP). I don't know much about Xi Jinping as a
            person so I don't think it would be appropriate to make a comment
            about them.

            Thank you. Is there anything that you suggest we can do, that can
            help the site owner who is potentially under arrest right now?

            Yes, I have found this whole situation very interesting so I have
            been trying to find as much undercover/ leaked footage as well as
            other first-hand accounts of the situation in Chian. I know some
            general knowledge about China's history but I am not super up to
            date on everything political other than with Hong Kong and the
            Coronavirus.

I wish I could properly translate this to you but sadly I think you would have a much easier time translating this to English than I would have translating it to Mandrin. I just wanted to say that it's truly amazing to me to see so many stand up against such scrutiny when there is so much at risk. I wish I had the bravery of you all. I just wanted to let you know that you have the full support of people from around the world and we wish you health and safety on your battle.
