            First we appreciate your support. It seems you learnt quite a bit of
            Chinese, since most of the articles, as well as the interface
            language is Chinese.


            Please excuse me for saying that, but I still doubt if you are
            really from the US. Just because it's the worst time in 2049bbs: the
            owner has gone missing, lots of Wumaos appeared.


            Just curious how did you find here?

            I understand your skepticism. I would like to start by saying that I
            know absolutely no Chinese, but I am able to understand the posts
            thanks to the insane power of Google Translate (It translate the
            entire web-page for me). I only found out about this website from
            this article:
            https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3081569/chinese-activists-detained-after-sharing-censored-coronavirus
            which talked about Terminus2049 which I then followed to this site.
            I realize that with the founders being arrested this site might
            sadly close down. I would be happy to answer any other questions you
            have about the outside world opinion of what is going on right now.

            Appreciated. Identity doesn't matter, at least to me. We will keep
            this dim light on till the last minute, with or without the
            founders.

            I am curious about the sentiment of you all living in the mainland.
            How do you think the view of the CCP has changed for the average
            mainlander?

            to me your Chinese is even better than your English?

            we now know you're from the SCMP article. would you mind telling us
            which state you're from and what's your opinion on the CCP first?
            such that we can respond with more meaningful answers.

            Broadly speaking, people don't believe the communism as they were,
            but plenty of them still count on CPP to maintain the social
            stability and economic growth.


            I doubt the users of this site (apparently not many) can provide you
            a good sample size or distribution.

            Before the epidemic I didn't really have a strong opinion regarding
            the CCP. However, after doing some research and seeing everything
            that has been going on from the lack of information to Hong Kong, I
            have gotten an ever decreasing view on the CCP. I don't want people
            to think that I am against the people of China or the country
            itself, its actually quite the opposite. It hurts me so much to see
            the abuse of rights of their own people by the CCP that I can't but
            despise them (the CCP). I don't know much about Xi Jinping as a
            person so I don't think it would be appropriate to make a comment
            about them.

            Yes, I have found this whole situation very interesting so I have
            been trying to find as much undercover/ leaked footage as well as
            other first-hand accounts of the situation in Chian. I know some
            general knowledge about China's history but I am not super up to
            date on everything political other than with Hong Kong and the
            Coronavirus.

            The only advice I can offer may not be the most helpful. If you want
            to help the site owner I would say the best thing to do is spread
            the ideology of this site. Explain to others how freedom of thought
            and expression is critical and how the coronavirus is an example of
            its importance. Try to bring change, in the very least in the minds
            of others, and hope that the owner's disappearance will not be in
            vain.

            @[jwright0080](/member/jwright0080) #2 Thank you for your support
            and your research into China. I would like to learn about the
            people's attitude towards CCP and the Chinese in your region. I am
            in one of the most gigantic cities in China where most people deem
            the origin of the coronavirus to be the US Army and that Communist
            China has some sort of constitutional merit compared to democracy.

            weird in my English-writing.

            @[习近平](/member/%E4%B9%A0%E8%BF%91%E5%B9%B3) #20 Overall your English
            is really good. There are a few parts that sound a little awkward
            but overall it's impressive (one of the biggest cities instead of
            gigantic, very much appreciate it instead of very appreciate it). To
            generalize it I would say that people in the US consider Chinese
            people to be quite intelligent. At the same time, I think that some
            think that part of the population in China is brainwashed. It is a
            little disheartening to hear that a lot of people believe that it
            came from the US Army, as the rest of the world seems to have come
            to a consensus that it originated in China.

            "Intelligent Chinese" is a typical stereotype. The frequent
            appearance of Chinese or Asian nerds in American movies and TV
            series deepens this stereotype. As for "brainwashing",
            unfortunately, it is a fact. The government's nationalist narrative
            has brainwashed many people. The "US army spreading virus" is only
            one episode in this narrative.

            how do people escape this brainwashing? What has made people become
            critical of the government and start to push back on their
            messaging? Are younger people becoming more anti-establishment in
            China or is it still pretty mixed?

            When people really have the freedom of speech that is written into
            the Constitution, they dare to criticize the government. However,
            many people are brainwashed for so long that their ideas cannot be
            changed immediately. A gradual process is necessary. It is hard to
            say that young people are more anti-establishment. A considerable
            part of the Wumao or" little pink" group consists of young people.
            But we also have young people like the three arrested volunteers.
            Therefore, young people in China cannot be generalized as a whole
            group.

            @[jwright0080](/member/jwright0080) #24 Well the escape from
            brainwashing is a road of harsh trials. I will try to explain it
            simply.


            According to a thesis on American Economic Review, China's
            censorship apparatus may remain robust to a large number of citizens
            receiving access to an uncensored internet. In order to bypass the
            censorship, people will have to have access to VPN or other
            circumvention technology, which itself is barred in China. Usually
            it wasn't until people's own interests are impaired(e.g. fake
            vaccine)that they try to look into social injustice, which is bring
            on by the CCP system.


            And China's brainwashing is more than this. We were taught, and
            socialized to learn that our ancestors were bullied by "Western
            Barbarians" and that we should revive the Celestial Empire to its
            former glory. Jingoism were folstered, and the values of individuals
            are contempted.


            As for the young generation, I myself belong to Gen-Z, and I have
            seen that people may become slightly more pro-democracy, though
            still outnumbered by the pro-establishment called little pink
            denoting that their ideology is coloured by CCP.


            PS: I would very appreciate it if you could figure out anything
            weird in my English-writing.


            Good day :D

I wish I could properly translate this to you but sadly I think you would have a much easier time translating this to English than I would have translating it to Mandrin. I just wanted to say that it's truly amazing to me to see so many stand up against such scrutiny when there is so much at risk. I wish I had the bravery of you all. I just wanted to let you know that you have the full support of people from around the world and we wish you health and safety on your battle.
